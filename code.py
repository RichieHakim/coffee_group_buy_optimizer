    Minimize the total absolute deviation from a target amount of coffee for each 
    personâ€“coffee pair, subject to lower and upper demand bounds. We allow fractional 
    splits of packages.

    RH 2025

    Args:
        coffee_packages (Dict[int, List[Tuple[float, float]]]):
            A mapping from coffee index c to a list of (size, cost) tuples, e.g.:
                {
                  0: [(100, 2.0), (500, 8.0)],
                  1: [(250, 3.0), (750, 9.0)]
                }
            Each tuple indicates a possible package size (grams) and a cost (not 
            used in the objective here, but used to ensure packages are discrete 
            increments).

        demands (Dict[Tuple[int, int], Tuple[float, float, float]]):
            A mapping (person, coffee) -> (lower_bound, upper_bound, target),
            e.g. demands[(0, 1)] = (100, 200, 150) means:
                - Person 0, Coffee 1
                - Must have between 100g and 200g
                - Target is 150g

        solver_name (str, optional):
            Which solver to use (passed to pulp). Defaults to "PULP_CBC_CMD".

    Returns:
        Dict[str, dict]:
            A dictionary with keys:
            - "x_c_k":  dict {(c, k): int} => how many packages of type k are purchased for coffee c
            - "a_n_c":  dict {(n, c): float} => allocated grams of coffee c to person n
            - "diff":   dict {(n, c): float} => the solver's absolute deviation variable for (n,c)
            - "total_deviation": float => the minimized sum of absolute deviations
